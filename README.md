# iOS-Calculator

Recreation of the iOS calculator for my app team iOS academy final project.
The app consists of two main views with some enums that make them up; the idea for the enums came from the internet and sped up the process a ton.
The main view consists of all of the buttons and display of the calculated total. The buttons are made with an enum and many switch statements.
The logic for the calculations is included in the main view file, although I wanted to have it in my model section (ran into some errors when making the changes).
The second view contains some binding variables that simply change the background color of the app for fun.

Here's a picture of the main view:
